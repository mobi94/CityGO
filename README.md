# CityGO
My first big project on Android.

The main goal of this work is to create a mobile app for Android OS for organizing thematic meetings on the map using social networks. 
The application performs user authentication through social networks, provides a convenient tool for creating, editing and viewing of 
meetings on the map, creates a profile with the user's personal information and allows to communicate with other meeting participants 
via group chat.

Parse and QuickBlox services have been using for data storage and processing, as well as for the organization of chat.

Parse Platform offers a complete back-end solution for mobile applications. The purpose of such a service - to completely eliminate the need to write server-side code and server configuration. Parse SDK is ready for use immediately after the integration of the project and requires minimal configuration on the part of the programmer.

QuickBlox - is a cloud service with functionality similar to the Parse. The reason for using this service is conditioned by the fact that QuickBlox, among other things, provides a convenient implementation of the SDK for building a messaging system based on XMPP protocol.
